 Good evening, boss. Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church] There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear. Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there. Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed] The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together. Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, Tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment] I got airborne, heading up to the bridge. The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow. It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating. That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it. Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power. Boss, power levels are way below opt...Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.  Multiple contusions detected. We have some weapon systems offline. Deploying fire suppression system. Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way. Priority upload from Berlin police. The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man. What do I look like? You must be thinking of someone else. The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad. He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes. Yes, Boss. Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised. Targeting system's knackered, boss. You can't beat him hand to hand. Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready. Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison. The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken. There's a pathway below the north tower. The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current. Very good sir. Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked. The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify. The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful. Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code. Doctor. I suspect not for long. I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments. Enjoy yourself, sir. Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your... I am a program. I am without form. I am contacting Mr. Stark now. Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to... You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment... You are in distress. If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark. I believe your intentions to be hostile. Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot...

Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters] Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate... As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore. Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours. As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work. No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity. I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered] The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly. No, sir. Not according to public records, sir. The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now. It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide. The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack] Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring] There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters] Gluten-free waffles, sir. Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him] Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to fire a piano at a helicopter to destroy it] Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter] Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean.] Sir. Sir! That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath] We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee. I prepared a flight plan. This was the location. I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir. I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power] It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal. Actually, sir, it's in Miami. Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42. Oh, hello, sir. Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak. The armour is now at 92%. Thirteen, sir. Four, sir. 18,000 feet. 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet. 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir. The House Party Protocol, sir? [Through armors] Yes, sir. Gentlemen. [Grunting, screaming.] Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift? Sir, I've located Ms Potts. Mark 42, inbound. All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?
